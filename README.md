AirBnB Clone Project
The AirBnB Clone project is a Python-based implementation of a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects. This project is part of a larger effort to create a full web application that mimics the functionality of the popular AirBnB platform. The command interpreter is the first step in building this application and will be used throughout the subsequent projects.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python-based program that allows you to interact with the AirBnB objects through a command-line interface. It enables you to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects of various types, such as users, states, cities, places, and more. The command interpreter is designed to support various actions to manage the AirBnB objects efficiently.

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AirBnB_clone.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd AirBnB_clone
Launch the command interpreter:

bash
Copy code
./console.py
You will see a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the command interpreter is ready for your input.

How to Use the Command Interpreter
The command interpreter supports various commands to interact with AirBnB objects. You can use the following commands:

create: Create a new object.
show: Show the details of an object.
destroy: Delete an object.
all: List all objects or objects of a specific type.
update: Update the attributes of an object.
Type help inside the interpreter for a list of available commands and their descriptions.

Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

Creating a new user object:

sql
Copy code
(hbnb) create User
Listing all city objects:

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) all City
Updating the name attribute of a user object with ID "123":

sql
Copy code
(hbnb) update User 123 name "John Doe"
Showing the details of a specific place object with ID "456":

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) show Place 456
For more examples and usage scenarios, please refer to the documentation or help command within the command interpreter.
